By design and social convention, texting and instant messaging are intended for short, simple, single issue message exchanges.

As a result, people receiving in an instant message are expecting a cookie. If you hand them a grocery bag full of stuff, they will either set it aside, or just pull a cookie out of it and deal with that.

If youâ€™re trying to get people to sort through a grocery bag, you need to use a different medium, like email, or a face-to-face meeting. Alternatively, you need to break your message into easy to consume cookies.
